README for Piwel's Advanced Moderation System for BeamMP 1.0

This little script is able to restrain people from coming to the server.
Since the KICK command from BeamMP isn't working, it's impossible to kick people out after banning them, wich means that you have to wait until they disconnect to be permabanned.

Add someone to the banlist :
Go Line 11 ;

Delete the last ")" before "then" ;

Add to the line or string.find(str, "Username"))

Replace "Username" by the player name

The user will never be able to join again.
